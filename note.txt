datetime from python


    1. Average deal vale for won deals the last year
     - First two errors:
     -------------------
     ValueError: time data '2019-06-05T00:00:00+02:00' does not match format '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ' python
     TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes.
     datetime.strptim dont work with %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
     - Solution was use pytz... and parser so UTC work , initialize both objects
       to one UTC, so it will be easier to compare.

     - Presented in Pygal pie chart and text:
     ------------------------------------------
     - Error: error in jinja2 : Namespace 'xlink' is not bound - svg:
       Solution: add on the jinja2 file :
        <svg viewBox="0 0 500 300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
        <image xlink:href="{{ pie_data }}" x="0" y="0" height="300" width="500"

     Controlled value is going on CMS:
     --------------------------------
     be on deals - filter the section on date: from 01-01-2022 and 31-12-22.
     filter on agreement
     download the file on excel , calculare average: 537582,6286.


    2. Number of won deals per month the last year

      Controlled value:
      -----------------
      - get agreement deals , filter by closed date (like one above)
      - export to excel fil - filter the file by months/date
      - select the jan - it will show the three counts - deal jan , same does it on front-end.

    - Present in pygal as bar chart:
    -------------------------------
      Not exactly an error, but on front-end of web, above bar chart
      it was written b/'n - which looked complete ugly.
      - solution: was adding a .slice (app.py) and on jinja file add, .decode("utf-8").
      what it does it  remove b/'n = byte string and convert to string.

    3. The total value of won deals per month the last year

    - I Assume that company is customer
    - I tried to get name of the company, but I got dealsname (which is wrong) instead of actual name of company.
    - It shows customer ID of each company, with total value per month from last year

    - A control is to check the CMS clint side - which is exactly alike. take the ID and filter search in value e.g.
    1010 , go in companies in cms - write in Id : 1010 (equal)  - AB Culinar (DEMO), then go to deals find search on
    company filter add the AB Culinar (DEMO), find values off three "deals" total value is 3025992.

    - Presented on tabel by jinja2.

    4. Didn't understand exactly the question.
     Error:
    json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) python = ingenting i objektet.
    solution: The verb, of the objects did not exist. So it was pointless.
    - would have done a test

    Few  tweeks I would had adjusted:
    ---------------------------------*
    - have sorted the months in one order instead of alphabetical
    - Find the companies name ....
    - run a test on question 4 + understand.
    - Cleaned the redundant on API call and on ptz.. utc , could had two methods and used in those three routs.
    redundant the

    -- (less imp):
    - Showed a pygal chart on question 2 - just for fun - show in pie chart .
    - Add a footer - info about company.
    - Would like to have all deals related to one single page. While companies its own.
